The Car Price Prediction App is a Machine Learning-based web application developed using Streamlit. The application predicts the selling price of used cars based on various input features such as brand, year, fuel type, transmission type, kilometers driven, and more.

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and deployment using an interactive web interface.
